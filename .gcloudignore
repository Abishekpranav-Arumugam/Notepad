# Build output from frontend (if GAE builds it, these local copies aren't needed)
# If your frontend/app.yaml serves PRE-BUILT files and GAE does NOT run 'npm run build'
# for the frontend, then you should NOT ignore these.

# Firebase Admin SDK Key file:
# The backend/app.yaml specifies:
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH: "./config/myapp-e88d6-firebase-adminsdk-z56sz-7b6696604b.json"
# This means the file `backend/config/myapp-e88d6-firebase-adminsdk-z56sz-7b6696604b.json`
# MUST BE UPLOADED with the backend service.
# Therefore, DO NOT add `backend/config/myapp-e88d6-firebase-adminsdk-z56sz-7b6696604b.json`
# or a general `*.json` pattern that would catch it to this .gcloudignore file.
#
# If you were using a different method (e.g., storing the JSON content in an env var),
# then you would ignore the local key file.
# Example of ignoring a specific key file if it were at the root and not needed:
# root-service-account-key.json

# Any other project-specific files or directories that should not be deployed.
# e.g., design mockups, temporary files, etc.
